summary: A Quake 1 port using Vulkan.
description: |
  vkQuake is a Quake 1 port using Vulkan instead of OpenGL for rendering. It is based on the popular QuakeSpasm port and runs all mods compatible with it like Arcane Dimensions or In The Shadows.
  
  Compared to QuakeSpasm vkQuake also features a software Quake like underwater effect, has better color precision, generates mipmap for water surfaces at runtime and has native support for anti-aliasing and AF.
  
  vkQuake also serves as a Vulkan demo application that shows basic usage of the API. For example it demonstrates render passes & sub passes, pipeline barriers & synchronization, compute shaders, push & specialization constants, CPU/GPU parallelism and memory pooling.
  
  - Note to snap packagers:
   Additionally, other snaps can consume its content via a content interface plug and use 'vkquake-launch' to start the engine. Consuming snaps could use following snapcraft.yaml snippet to add the interface.
   
  plugs:
    quake-engine:
    content: quake-engine
    interface: content
    target: $SNAP/quake-engine
    default-provider: vkquake:quake-engine
   
  Within the consuming snap the content would be exposed at "$SNAP/quake-engine", ie:
     /snap/the-consuming-snap/current/quake-engine
     /var/lib/snapd/snap/the-consuming-snap/current/quake-engine
   
   Under certain circumstances it could be necessary to manually connect the interface, ie:
     snap connect the-consuming-snap:quake-engine vkquake:quake-engine
